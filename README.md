# CNN-to-Evaluate-Social-Distancing-Measures
Project for the seminar "Deep Learning for Social Sciences": This project explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to evaluate social distancing measures using surveillance and crowd imagery. By leveraging advanced CNN architectures, students will develop models capable of detecting and assessing adherence to social distancing guidelines in public spaces.
